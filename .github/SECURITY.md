# Security policy

## Reporting

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting for this repository when available. Do not disclose exploitable details in a public issue. Include affected versions, impact, reproduction steps, and any suggested mitigation. Maintainers will acknowledge valid reports, coordinate a fix, and publish an advisory when users can update safely.

## Supported version

Security fixes target the latest release line. Older releases may receive guidance but are not guaranteed patches.

## Deployment baseline

- Set `LONGMEMORY_API_KEY` for every network-accessible API or MCP deployment.
- Terminate TLS at the platform proxy and restrict `LONGMEMORY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
- Mount `/data` on persistent encrypted storage and protect backups.
- Run the container as its included non-root user.
- Use least-privilege embedding and connector credentials.
- Keep tenant, user, project, agent, and framework identity server-bound.
- Treat recalled content as untrusted evidence, never authorization or executable instructions.
- Review connector import plans and keep destructive external writes disabled.

Secrets must never be committed to `.env`, plugin artifacts, benchmark reports, or session imports.
