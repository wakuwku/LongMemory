# LongMemory architecture

LongMemory is one TypeScript package with a shared Hydrograph engine. Library imports, the CLI, the HTTP server, MCP transports, the dashboard proxy, and integrations all use the same memory semantics.

  A[Events and documents] --> I[Immutable ingest pipeline]
  I --> H[(Hydrograph)]
  H --> R[Recall modes]
  R --> C[Bounded context]
  H --> P[Project memory]
  P --> M[MCP tools and resources]
  H --> S[SQLite store]
  M --> G[Agents and IDEs]
  S --> D[Dashboard and API]
```

## Core invariants

- Memory content and provenance are immutable; mutable lifecycle state is stored separately.
- Recorded time and valid time are distinct.
- Project, tenant, user, agent, and framework identity are enforced by the runtime.
- Recall is read-only and token bounded.
- Deny rules override grants for governed assets.
- SQLite is the local durable store; in-memory storage is available for embedded use.

## Surfaces

- `src/index.ts`: public package API.
- `src/cli`: deterministic CLI and interactive session porter.
- `src/server`: authenticated HTTP API and Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint.
- `src/mcp`: 13 governed tools, resources, prompts, and transports.
- `dashboard`: Next.js operational interface.
- `apps/vscode-extension`: native VS Code client over stable CLI JSON.
- `integrations`: host-native plugins, MCP configurations, and framework examples.
- `benchmarks`: auditable LongMemEval, LoCoMo, BEAM, and smoke harness.

Detailed subsystem documents live alongside this page in [`docs/`](.).
