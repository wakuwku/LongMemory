# Governance

LongMemory is maintained by CaviraOSS through an open contribution process.

## Roles

- Contributors submit issues, documentation, code, integrations, or review.
- Maintainers triage work, review changes, manage releases, and enforce project policy.
- Release managers publish npm, container, and editor artifacts after release checks pass.

## Decisions

Routine decisions use pull-request review and maintainer consensus. Changes to persistence contracts, public APIs, security boundaries, licensing, or governance require a documented proposal and approval from at least two maintainers when available. Security incidents may be handled privately until remediation is published.

## Releases

Releases use Semantic Versioning and signed Git tags where possible. The release commit must pass `pnpm release:check`, document user-visible changes, contain no active legacy branding, and have matching package and tag versions.

## Conflicts of interest

Reviewers must disclose financial, employment, or personal conflicts that could reasonably affect judgment and recuse themselves when appropriate.
